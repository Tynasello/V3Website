            <h2>Purpose</h2>
            <p>
              The purpose of this project was to create a system that would sort Skittles based on color.
                Two micro servo motors were used in the project; one to pick up
                the Skittles, and one to drop them into designated cups. A TCS230 color sensor was used to read
                color. Red, green, and yellow skittles were sorted and dropped into corresponding cups.

            <h2>Micro Controller</h2>
              <p>
                  The Arduino Uno is a microcontroller that is responsible for commanding the two servos and the
                  color sensor. The Arduino has digital input/output pins
                  and analog pins that are responsible for sending and receiving data. The arduino is powered via a
                  USB port.

            <h2>Micro Servo Motors</h2>
              <p>
                  Two micro servo motors were used in this project. One was attached to a circular rotating
                  platform designed to pick a Skittle up from an entry tube. The servo then positioned the Skittle
                  underneath the sensor where color determination occurred. Lastly, The Skittle was dropped onto
                  the slide where it would fall into a desired cup. The second servo was responsible for properly
                  angling the slide.

            <h2>TCS230 Color Sensor</h2>
              <p>
                  The color sensor contains 64 photodiodes, evenly distributed as red, green, blue and clear which
                  are responsible for color readings. The TCS230's
                  readings are converted from current to frequency allowing the Arduino to differentiate between
                  skittle color. A website that assisted my understanding of the TCS230 can be
                  found <a class="intext-link center-end-hover" target="_blank"

            <h2>Framework</h2>
              <p>
                  The frame was built out of scrap wood that I cut, hand sanded and drilled together. The rotating
                  platform was hand made and fitted to one of the servos. It was designed to pickup skittles from the
                  entry pipe (part of rubber hosing) and bring them directly underneath the color sensor. They were
                  then transported to a
                  drilled hole in the shelf where they would fall onto the slide, which was designed using the back
                  of a drywall corner bead.

            <h2>Coding</h2>
              <p>
                  The program to control this robot was written in the <a class="intext-link center-end-hover" target="_blank"
                   href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/software">Arduino IDE</a> using the programming language C/C++.
                  The Servo.h library was included to control the two micro servos. Two micro servo objects were
                  created, one for the job of picking up the skittles, and the other for setting the path towards a
                  certain cup. The micro servos were controlled using the write() function that would turn the servos
                  based on the degree amount inputted. The TCS230 color sensor was utilized by using the pulseIn()
                  function that would read the output frequency detected by the sensor. These values were then
                  inserted into three different if statements (one for red, green, and yellow) that would determine
                  skittle color based on pre-determined frequency numbers that corresponded to each color. A link to
                  my github repository for this code is below. <br>

            <h2>Challenges</h2>
              <p>
                  Throughout this project I faced two significant issues. The first was the
                  inability of the Arduino to accurately differentiate color. This was result of color
                  frequencies being
                  too similar. To remedy, I continually adjusted the distance between the platform and the sensor
                  allowing more variety in frequency numbers to occur. The Arduino could now distinguish between
                  different colors.
                  <br><br>
                  The second problem was getting the entry tube for the skittles to reliably work. I originally had a
                  transparent piece
                  of tubing, however, the diameter of the tube was approximately a 1/8" larger than that of a
                  skittle. This extra room allowed skittles to topple to the sides of each other, resulting in
                  them getting stuck. After experimenting with various diameters, I eventually found a size which
                  functioned dependably.
