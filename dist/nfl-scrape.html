            <h2>Purpose</h2>
            <p>
                The purpose of this project was to see if there is a correlation between the amount of wins a team
                has, and the amount of yards they have passed for. I data scraped espn.com to retrieve the
                passing stats of each team in the NFL, alongside the amount of wins they have in the 2020-2021
                season. This data was pushed to a CSV file entitled team_stats.
                <br><br>
                <img id="team_stats_image" src="images/nfl-scraper/team_stats.png" alt="">
                <br><br>
                For this project, only the team name, amount of wins, and passing yards was relevant. Therefore, I
                extracted those values for each team and created a new CSV file entitled wins_yards. The correlation
                coefficient equation was then used to find if there was a relation between the amount of wins for a
                team, and the amount of yards they have passed for.

            <h2>Coding</h2>
            <p>
                <br><span style="font-weight: bold">Data Scraping</span>
                <br><br>
                This project was coded in Python 3.8. The BeautifulSoup module was imported to allow the
                data scrape of
                <a
                        class="intext-link center-end-hover" target="_blank"
                        href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/stats/team/_/view/offense/stat/passing/table/passing/sort/netPassingYards/dir/desc">ESPN</a>.
                A BeautifulSoup object named soup was created and used to find the container holding team names
                and team stats, as
                they were held in different places.
                <br><br>
                <code style="font-size: .8rem">team_elements_container = soup.find_all(class_="Table__TR Table__TR--sm
                    Table__even")</code>
                <br>
                <code style="font-size: .8rem">stat_elements_container = soup.find_all(class_="Table__Scroller")</code>
                <br><br>
                The team names were held under an element with class ‘Table__TR Table__TR--sm Table__even’ and the
                stats under class ‘Table__Scroller’. To find the nested teams name and stats, I treated the newly
                created
                container variables in similar manner as the soup object
                <br><br>
                Unfortunately, team wins were not displayed on the passing stats chart, therefore I scraped them from
                <a class="intext-link center-end-hover" target="_blank" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/standings/_/group/league">
                    here</a> in the same
                way as
                before.
                With all extracted data, I created a dictionary. Each value had an appropriate key describing what
                stat the value represented.
                <br><BR>
                <span style="font-weight: bold">Writing to CSV file</span>
                <br><br>
                I created a file named team_stats.csv and opened it as csvfile
                <br><br>
                <code style="font-size: .8rem">stats_file = "team_stats.csv"</code>
                <br>
                <code style="font-size: .8rem">with open(stats_file, 'w') as csvfile:</code>
                <br><br>
                I then used the writeheader() and writerow() methods to write stat types as column section headers,
                and their corresponding values for each team in the rows. To meet the end goal of this project, only
                the team name, wins, and passing yards was relevant. Therefore, I extracted those values into a new
                dictionary and wrote them to wins_yards.csv using the same method described above. Data In
                wins_yards.csv was then used to determine the correlation between team wins and passing yards.

            <h2>Finding Correlation</h2>
            <p>
             To find if there is a correlation between wins and passing yards, I used the Pearson method: I found the
                correlation coefficient using the correlation coefficient equation. The correlation coefficient is in
                the range of -1 to 1. A value of 0 symbolizes no correlation, where as 1 and -1 represent strong
                correlations in the positive or negative direction respectively.
                <br>
                <img src="images/nfl-scraper/eq.png" alt="">
                <br>
                To use this method I treated wins as ‘X’ and passing yards as ‘Y’. I created an ‘XY’, ‘X^2’, and
                ‘Y^2’ column, as well as a ‘Sum’ row on the table. ‘XY’ representing the amount of wins for a team
                times the amount of passing yards, and ‘X^2’ and ‘Y^2’ meaning the amount of wins and passing yards
                squared respectively. Calculations were done to find values for the newly added columns. Lastly, the
                sum of all column values was determined and inserted to the 'Sum' row. Numbers in the
                ‘Sum’ row were applied to the correlation coefficient equation.
                <br>

            <i></i>
            <h2>Result</h2>
            <p>
             After calculations, the correlation coefficient was 0.36. This value means there was a slight
                positive correlation between the amount of wins and passing yards per team in the 2020-2021 NFL season.
                It is
                unclear whether this was a direct correlation or merely a result of another factor.
                <br><br>
                In the near future I plan on broadening the scope of values scraped, either by adding more
                years to the data set or comparing values from 2020 to the 1970’s to see if there is a notable
                difference in the correlation coefficient.
                I am also looking into creating a command line tool for this project. <br>
